    about:
      "Pills, pills, pills, everywhere. This is the gist of my life as a pharmacist of 6 years. As a legal drug dealer I have worked in a variety of settings including retail, managed care and clinical pharmacy. I grew interested in coding after watching coding videos and speaking to my friends and family in the field. This made me ultimately decide to join the Fullstack Academy bootcamp. Throughout the course I have grown to truly love the dynamic world of coding. I look forward to my journey down this road and hope I can combine my prior experience as a pharmacist into this new world.",
